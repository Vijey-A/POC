## **Summary**
Udemy’s Android mobile app has a pricing inconsistency that allows users to **purchase courses at a lower price** when the internet is toggled off and then back on. Users can exploit this issue to purchase these discounted courses at an unintended lower price, leading to potential revenue loss for Udemy and instructors.

## **Impact**
- **Domain/Scope Impacted:** Udemy Android App (potentially iOS as well).
- **Users Impacted:**
  - All users who discover this issue can **buy courses at a lower price** than the intended sale price.
  - Udemy may **lose revenue** due to unintended price reductions.
- **How Users Are Impacted:**
  - Users can manipulate the pricing by temporarily disabling their internet connection and getting a **discounted price** that is not part of Udemy’s intended pricing model.
  - This allows **bypassing special sale pricing**, reducing Udemy’s control over discounts and potentially affecting instructors’ revenue shares.

## **Browsers Verified In**
(Not applicable since this is a **mobile app issue**. However, the issue is confirmed on multiple Android devices.)

### **Tested Devices:**
- **Android Mobile** (Model: `One Plus Nord CE 2 Lite`,  Android Version: `12`)
- **Android Tablet** (Model: `Honor Pad X9`,  Android Version : `13`, Magic OS : ` 7.1`)

## **Steps to Reproduce**
1. **Open the Udemy Android App** with an active internet connection.
2. Navigate to a **main/course page (PDP - Product Detail Page)** and check the special sales banner. Check a course (e.g., ₹449).
3. **Turn off the internet** (disable Wi-Fi/mobile data or enable Airplane Mode).
4. Stay on the same page and then **turn the internet back on** after a few seconds.
5. The **course price now appears lower** (e.g., ₹399 instead of ₹449).
6. Proceed to checkout and successfully **purchase the course at ₹399**, despite the original sale price being ₹449.
7. The transaction is completed at the **incorrect lower price**, confirming the exploit.

## **Supporting Material/References**
- **Screen recording of the issue on mobile and tablet**, showing:
  - Price difference in **PDP (Product Detail Page)** and **PLP (Product Listing Page)**.
  - Step-by-step proof of toggling the internet off and on.
  - Successful checkout at the unintended lower price.
- **Screenshots** highlighting:
  - Price before internet toggle (higher).
  - Price after internet toggle (lower).
  - Successful purchase with the incorrect price.

(Attached the screen recordings and screenshots to the report.)

## **Expected Behavior**
- When the internet is **on/off**, the Udemy app should **refresh and display the correct price** based on real-time sale conditions before allowing checkout.

## **Actual Behavior**
- The app **retains a lower cached price** and allows users to purchase at a **discounted unintended rate**.

## **Additional Notes**
- This issue might be due to **client-side caching of price data** when the internet connection is lost.
- The vulnerability is easy to **replicate without advanced skills**, increasing the likelihood of widespread abuse.

## **Fix**
- Ensure that the app **revalidates the course price** with the Udemy servers when internet connectivity is restored, before allowing checkout.

## Impact

## **Domain/Scope Impacted:**
- The issue exists in the **Udemy Android application**, and it is possible that the same vulnerability exists on the **iOS application** as well.
- The pricing mechanism on the Udemy mobile app does not correctly validate or update the course price after reconnecting to the internet when the app is initially launched offline.

## **Users Impacted:**

### **1. End Users (Buyers/Students):**  
- Any user who is aware of this issue can **intentionally exploit** it to purchase courses at a **lower price than Udemy’s officially set price** during a sale event.  
- This creates an **unfair advantage** for users who manipulate the pricing mechanism, as they can consistently buy courses at the lowest possible price rather than the dynamically adjusted price intended by Udemy.

### **2. Udemy (Company and Business Model):**  
- Udemy's **revenue is directly impacted** because courses are being sold at a lower, unintended price.  
- This **disrupts Udemy’s pricing strategy** and devalues its sales model, potentially affecting revenue predictions and financial planning.  
- The discounting system appears to have an inconsistency that **does not properly sync with Udemy’s live pricing model** upon reconnecting to the internet.

### **3. Instructors on Udemy:**  
- Since Udemy shares revenue with instructors, **instructor earnings may be affected** due to the unintended pricing drop.  
- If Udemy’s revenue per course sale is reduced because of this pricing bug, instructors will **receive a lower revenue share per sale**, impacting their expected earnings.  
- This issue could also **undermine trust** between Udemy and its instructors, as they may not be aware that their courses are being sold for a lower-than-intended amount.

## **How Users Are Impacted:**

### **Pricing Exploitation:**  
- Users can **manipulate Udemy’s pricing algorithm** by launching the Udemy mobile app while **offline**, waiting for the pricing to load, and then reconnecting to the internet.  
- This results in a price that is **lower than the regular sale price**, allowing users to purchase courses **at a discount that was not officially offered**.

### **Loss of Pricing Integrity:**  
- Udemy’s sale prices are typically designed to **fluctuate dynamically** based on user behavior, demand, and location.  
- This bug **bypasses the intended pricing mechanisms**, allowing users to **override Udemy’s real-time discounting strategies** and always get the cheapest possible price.

### **Potential for Abuse at Scale:**  
- If this issue becomes widely known, it could be **exploited at scale**, leading to mass purchases at unintended discounted rates.  
- **Automated scripts or bots** could be developed to exploit this bug systematically, causing further financial losses for Udemy.  
- This could also lead to a **negative impact on Udemy’s perceived value**, as users may begin expecting or relying on these unintended discounts rather than Udemy’s legitimate sales.

## **Financial and Security Implications:**
- **Revenue Leakage:** Udemy is losing revenue for each instance where a user exploits this issue to purchase courses at a lower price.
- **Loss of Pricing Control:** The bug allows users to bypass Udemy’s intended pricing model, undermining its sales and marketing strategies.
- **Negative Brand Reputation:** If users openly discuss or share this exploit online, it could **harm Udemy’s credibility and trust** among instructors and legitimate buyers.
- **Incentive for Fraudulent Purchases:** Users could **exploit this vulnerability multiple times** to purchase courses at the lowest price, potentially leading to large-scale abuse.
